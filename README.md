**My views on Quality Assurance**:\
I am a seasoned QA engineer, passionate about software quality and test automation.\
I believe that quality is the most important phase in the software development life cycle. If the product is not fit for use, if it does not meet customer expectations, or if it is not risk-free, then the entire planning, design, and development phases are worth nothing.\
Moreover, quality is free, meaning the money companies spend on support calls, change requests, and post-release bug fixes can be significantly reduced if they invest some time and money in ensuring their product is thoroughly tested.. 

**About Me**:\
I am an experienced QA Engineer with over 10 years of experience in Quality Assurance, Test Automation, and Performance Testing. I am proficient in both manual and automated testing, specializing in creating test automation frameworks using tools like Python (Selenium, Robot Framework, Pytest), and Java (Cucumber, Selenium, TestNG, Maven). Additionally, I have extensive experience in API Testing, Performance Testing, and integrating automation with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub).\
I have worked on a variety of projects, including cloud-native applications, SaaS products, and enterprise security solutions. I have also collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure the delivery of high-quality software. I am particularly passionate about improving testing efficiency through automation, while maintaining a strong focus on security, data integrity, and performance..

**My Automation Projects - Practice**:\
Here are a few projects I have worked on to demonstrate my knowledge and hands-on experience with popular automation tools. While these projects may not be complex, they effectively showcase my skills, and I will continue to update them to stay aligned with these technologies.
