# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio.
Sharing below a few projects which I have to worked on to demostrate my knowledge and hands-on experience popular automation tools. 
Although this is just a demostration of my skills. I will keep on updating these projects to stay connected with these technologies. 

**My views on Quality Assurance**:
I am seasoned QA engineer, passionate about software quality and test automation.
I beleive that Quality is the most important phase in software development life cycle. If the product is not fit for use, if the products is not meetings the customer expectation, if the product is not risk-free, whole planning, design, and development phase are worth nothing.
Moreover, Quality is Free, meaning the money companies spent on support-calls, change-requests, post-release bug-fixes can be reduced significantly if they invest some time and money on making sure their product is tested throughly.
